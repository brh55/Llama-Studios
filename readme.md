First 'llama' tell you that if you've stumbled across this page in hopes to find something boring, then you'll be quite disappointed. Because quite frankly, you've just stumbled upon one of the best development studios in Llama history, no wait MAJESTIC History.

## Disclaimer
Llamas in the photos were all treated under the fair treatments outlined by "Llama vs Buffalo" case.

## How to get things spinning for development
1. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/brh55/Llama-Studios.git`
2. cd to repo: `cd llama-studios`
3. run build: `gulp`
4. now your browser should have it up and running (can I get a "yay 4 hay!")

### For Production
5. run web server: `node index.js`

### Keep llama-ing on! ![Llama on](http://orig05.deviantart.net/fee3/f/2010/094/f/d/llama_walk_by_taquito143.gif)

    This was for the Zappos challenge for 2016. But, I encourage you to inspect the code, use some of it for
    your projects, and learn from it as well. It's no means a reflection of what is expected, 
    one must find it within themselves to create their vision of llama history. ;)
    
    If this was also useful, go ahead and star it to spread the love. You are more than welcome to ask me questions 
    in the issue section as well, I'll respond!
