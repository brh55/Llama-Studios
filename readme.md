First 'llama' tell you that if you've stumbled across this page in hopes to find something boring, then you'll be quite disappointed. Because quite frankly, you've just stumbled upon one of the best development studios in Llama history, no wait MAJESTIC History.

## Disclaimer
Llamas in the photos were all treated under the fair treatments outlined by "Llama vs Buffalo" case.

1. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/brh55/Zappos-Internship-Challenge-AMA.git`
2. cd to repo: `cd llama-studios`

    This was for the Zappos front-end internship challenge for 2016. I'm leaving this code FOSS, I encourage
    you to inspect the code, use some of it for your projects, and learn from it as well.
    It's no means a reflection of what is expected, but more so a reference or baseline for your projects.
    "One must find it within themselves to create their vision of llama history! :)"
    
    If this was also useful, go ahead and star it to spread the love. You are more than welcome to ask me questions 
    in the issue section as well, I'll respond!
    If you are curious, I did move into the on-site interview, but unfortunately did not make the 
    final cut. However, I absolutely encourage you to still try apply for Zappos internship, and
    take advantage of meeting the other canidates! I'm still good friends with a few of the pople
    I met on my interview.
